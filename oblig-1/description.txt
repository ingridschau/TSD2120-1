Create a program that creates a child process with fork(). This child process will generate a random number between 0 and 1000. 
The parent process will guess the number by sending this number to the child process. 
The child process will answer with -1 when the number is too high, 0 when the number has been found and 1 when the number is too low. 
For this pipe() will be used, making it possible to communicate between processes. 
After the parent process has guessed correctly, the correct number will be printed as well as how many attempts the parent process used. 

This task will be done in Linux and made in C.
